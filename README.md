# AI-Powered Resume Screening Project

This project is an AI-powered tool that:
- Scrapes resumes and job descriptions from the web.
- Uses the OpenAI API to analyze and compare the content.
- Classifies each resume into two categories: **fit** and **unfit** based on keywords, skills, and relevance.
